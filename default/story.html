<h1>The Story</h1>

<p>
Buy one beanie, support two girls fulfill one dream.<br/>
</p>

<p>
This brand founded by four young people who all share the same passion for boardsports.
</p>

<p>
    We all have our own dreams to chase. Annelous and Isabelle share the same dream of being a professional kiteboarding athlete
    and competing with the best girls in the world. The whole idea of creating our own business started because kiteboarding is not yet an olympic sport.
    This means we get no financial support and with the current economy it's difficult to get many sponsors.
    At the same time Yorrick and Katja always dreamed of creating their own brand.
    Together we formed a team of passioned, creativite and motivated people ready to take the challenge.
    We made the decision to take control and build our own business to realize the dream of Annelous and Isabelle.
    We are prepared and love to work hard in every single way, on the water and now for our own brand.
</p>

<p>
Because mother nature provides us with everything we need to do what we love, we want to show her our gratitude. We are a fully sustainable company, all the materials we use are recycled or produced with respect for nature.
</p>

<p>
If you want to support our initiative, buy a beanie and you will help Annelous and Isabelle in being a professional kiteboarding athlete!
</p>

<h1>Handmade</h1>

All the beanies are handmade by ourselves. We have the different models but every beanie is unique.

<h1>Our Logo</h1>

<p>
SiS, the abbreviation of Sea is Snow, sea equals snow. The name inhabits the fact that we love our sports and the lifestyle which belongs to it. In summer we enjoy kitesurfing, in winter snowboarding, both based on the same element water. The way the triangle in our logo is turned stands for the element water. Inside the triangle you find the electrocardiography of every surfer or boarder. Enjoying the perfect conditions to do what we love, makes our heartbeat goes faster.
</p>

<p>
Challenge your heartbeat!
